## Guide

### Step 1
Launch Helium from Launchpad

You should now see a window that looks like this

### Step 2
Open the *Location* menu from the Menu Bar, then select *Open Web URL*, or press *Command+L*

Once the Enter Destination URL popup appears, type in *https://joshatticus.is-a.dev/NAPbypass/helium-tools*

### Step 3
You should see this screen now

From here, you can scroll down and explore.

### Step 4
Now it's time to open the NAPLAN locked down browser. **This will likely close your current browser, so read these instructions first!**

Open the NAPLAN locked down browser, but don't join the test. We will now test that you can access Helium Tools.

Press *Command+Q* on your keyboard. You should see a popup asking for an admin password, and Helium Tools. If you can see Helium Tools, good job, you can now join the test.

*I would get a screenshot for this tutorial, but it seems that NAPLAN locked down browser prevents screenshots.*
